# Josh Hall Portfolio

## Content updates

Edit all site content in `src/content/content.ts`. The data in that file drives every page, including project detail routes, skills, education, and contact info.

## Notes

- The site uses Vite + React + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and React Router with HashRouter for GitHub Pages compatibility.
- Replace `public/og.png` with your own Open Graph image if desired.


## TODO:
1) Fewer tabs at the top. I want Home, Projects, Contact, and Resume. I want to put experience, skills, and leadership into the projects tab. I want the "Experience" tab, that is now moving into projects, to be a timeline that you see in projects. I want skills to be moved into projects. Leadership also moved into projects.

2) Move Education onto the home page


3) In projects tab have filters for the tags like C#, Unity, Python, FastAPI, or be able to search for  tags that a project might have.

4) Separate the projects into disciplines (game design, databases, data science, hci, etc. for example. Split them up into whatever they actually are. The idea is so that companies that do game design can easily see my game design projects in one place)

5) add link to my github (https://github.com/agwe422) on the home page, bottom of the screen and in contact

6) On the home page, move the contact bubble under the about section to be next to the View projects, download resume, and linkedin bubbles (so remove that box and just move contact up above)

7) Currently the text: "Software Engineer." populates the description text under my name and under the "About" section. I want these to be separate. I want the description under my name to say Software Engineer. (as it already does), and I want the about section to say something different. Add this to the about section: Software Engineering student at Cal Poly (BS Software Engineering, Sept 2022-Jun 2026). Interested in full-stack development, mobile, AR, and game development.
