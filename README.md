# Josh Hall Portfolio

## Content updates

Edit all site content in `src/content/content.ts`. The data in that file drives every page, including project detail routes, skills, education, and contact info.

## Notes

- The site uses Vite + React + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and React Router with HashRouter for GitHub Pages compatibility.
- Replace `public/og.png` with your own Open Graph image if desired.


## TODO:
Fewer tabs at the top
In projects tab have filters for the tags like C#, Unity, Python, FastAPI (maybe......)
Separate the projects into disciplines (game design, databases, data science, hci, etc.)
add more personal projects
add link to my github
maybe move the linkedin and contact bubble to be next to the View projects, download resume, and linkedin bubbles (so remove that box and just move contact up above)
