## Content updates

Edit all site content in `src/content/content.ts`. The data in that file drives every page, including project detail routes, skills, education, and contact info.

## Notes

- The site uses Vite + React + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and React Router with HashRouter for GitHub Pages compatibility.
- Replace `public/og.png` with your own Open Graph image if desired.
